This howto explains how to build 'jpylyzer' as a 32-bit Windows executable so that Python is no longer a dependency. Procedure described here will also pack binaries in a distribution-ready ZIP file!

This was tested under Windows 7 using PyInstaller 2.0. (I haven't found a way to build actual Win64 binaries, since the build packages don't appear to support this yet).

SET-UP AND CONFIGURATION (YOU ONLY NEED TO GO THROUGH THESE STEPS ONCE):

1. Download 'pyinstaller' from http://www.pyinstaller.org/

2. unpack/unzip it with your favourite file archive manager. Note: this has to be a location where
   a user who will run the package (i.e. build the jpylyzer executable) has write access!! 

3. Run the pyinstaller configuration script ('python Configure.py')

5. Open the batch file 'buildWin32.bat' which is part of the jpylyzer distribution, and update the 
   configuration variables 'python' and 'pathPyInstaller' according to your own system

BUILDING THE WIN32 DISTRIBUTION:

1. From the jpylyzer root dir (i.e. the directory in which jpylyzer.py is installed), run the
   following batch file:

buildWin32.bat

2. Look at the zip file in the directory 'dist_win32'.

Voila!
