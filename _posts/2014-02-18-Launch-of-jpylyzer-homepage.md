title: Launch of jpylyzer homepage

{% include JB/setup %}

At long last *jpylyzer* has its own homepage. From now on these pages will be the main channel for updates on this tool. This also means that [the old *jpylyzer* page on the main site of the Open Planets Foundation](http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/software/jpylyzer) is now largely obsolete (we&#8217;ll probably put a redirect there to the current pages).
