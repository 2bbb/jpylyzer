##About jpylyzer
*Jpylyzer* is a validator and feature extractor for *JP2* images. *JP2* is the still image format that is defined by [Part 1](http://www.jpeg.org/public/15444-1annexi.pdf) of the [JPEG 2000](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image compression standard (ISO/IEC 15444-1).

This tool was specifically created to answer the following questions that you might have about a *JP2* file:

1. Is this really a *JP2*, and does it conform to the format&#8217;s specifications (validation)?
2. What are the technical characteristics of the image (feature extraction)?
