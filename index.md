##What is jpylyzer?
*Jpylyzer* is a validator and feature extractor for *JP2* images. *JP2* is the still image format that is defined by [Part 1](http://www.jpeg.org/public/15444-1annexi.pdf) of the [JPEG 2000](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/) image compression standard (ISO/IEC 15444-1).

*Jpylyzer* tells you if a *JP2* image really a conforms to the format&#8217;s specifications (validation). It also reports the image&#8217;s technical characteristics (feature extraction).
